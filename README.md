## Features

- Realistic flight simulation powered by the XPlane platform.
- Data collector for capturing various flight parameters and events.
- OpenAI Gym interface for reinforcement learning experiments.
- Highly customizable simulation environment.
- Easy-to-use and well-documented codebase.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/HemuManju/nasa-uli-xplane.git

   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your XPlane installation and simulator settings as needed.

## Usage

1. Launch the simulator by running:

   ```
   python simulator.py
   ```

2. Explore the simulation environment, adjust settings, and start flying!

## Data Collector

The data collector module allows you to capture various flight data, including aircraft state, control inputs, and environmental conditions. This collected data can be used for analysis, visualization, or machine learning purposes.

To use the data collector, refer to the documentation in the `data_collector` directory.
